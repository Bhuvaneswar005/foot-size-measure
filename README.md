# foot-size-measure
This project determines a person's foot and corresponding shoe size using an image of the foot as input. 
It preprocesses the image and runs a k-means clustering algorithm for colour-based segmentation. Then it detects contours by doing edge detection. Finally, a bounding box is generated that measures the size of the foot.
